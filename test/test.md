Here we are going to explore the sensitivity of glacier length to bed slope and changes in climate using numerical models. The glacier length will be dependent on the rate at which ice flows into the terminus from above, relative to the rate at which it melts at the terminus. The flow rate is dependent on both the ice thichness nad the speed, which are in turn dependent on the flow rate.

First, let us begin the analytical model to get at this sensitivity simply from mass continuity.

Consider a glacier as an infinitely wide slab of ice on a bed with a constant slope and balance gradient.

The net specific balance at any elevation on the glacier is then given by:
