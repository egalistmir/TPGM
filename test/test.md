Here we are going to explore the sensitivity of glacier length to bed slope and changes in climate using numerical models. The glacier length will be dependent on the rate at which ice flows into the terminus from above, relative to the rate at which it melts at the terminus. The flow rate is dependent on both the ice thichness nad the speed, which are in turn dependent on the flow rate.
